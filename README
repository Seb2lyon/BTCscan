Searches a file or all files within a folder including subfolders for Bitcoin
related Base58Check encoded strings.

(Update 31/03/18) Feedback has indicated that certain versions of Python 3 causes the script to fail.
BTCscan.py has been confirmed to work under Python 3.5.3, 3.6.1 and 3.7.


BTCscan.py [-i/--input=][drive:][path][filename] [args]

-i / --input       Specifies drive, directory, and/or files to search
-q / --quick       Quick mode, does not search BIP32 HD walllet keys
-u / --unicode     Unicode mode, only search for unicoded items
-n / --nonunicode  Non-unicode mode, only search for non-unicoded items

If you find BTCscan to be of use to yourself, organisation or company then I
politely ask that you write me a very short email letting me know how it
worked out for you. This information will never be published - it is solely
for my own personal interest.
